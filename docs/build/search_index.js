Similar concepts are often united in a single more general concept and so on. This idea of concepts hierarchy is reflected in Julia's type system. The package, on example of the alternating projections (AP) framework, introduces the main concepts of AP as hierarchy of types. Some of these implementations are obvious, some look artificial, and might be improved later, with the overall goal not the efficiency, but closeness to the mathematical text.","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"AlternatingProjections.jl","title":"AlternatingProjections.jl","text":"Consider, for instance, how you would explain to someone a method of alternating projections (see the previous chapter). By explaining it, you would mention concepts of sets, then you would mark some of them as feasible sets by requiring them to have some properties, for instance, being convex. Then you would explain what is the projection operation and how is it related to finding the closest point in the convex set. Then you would introduce the broad class of the alternating projections, specifying that here you will use its variant sometimes named as POCS (projections on the convex sets), and explain that the method proceeds iteratively and converges either to a feasible point or to a stable cycle of length 2 (for 2 sets). You would, most probably, mention that in practice the method is allowed to run for some fixed number of iterations or until the points get close enough to each other.","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"AlternatingProjections.jl","title":"AlternatingProjections.jl","text":"In this informal explanation one can extract however several important formal or abstract concepts.  These are of the feasible sets, convex sets as a particular case of feasible sets, concept of projection operator, abstract concept of a feasibility problem, and a concept of a method of alternating projections to solve it, with a particular subtype POCS and maybe a supertype of abstract \"algorithm\". These abstract and particular concepts can be implemented in Julia as abstract and concrete types, but you might think why does ne need to do it, as the algorithm itself is quite straightforward to program in most languages. Well, the idea to do implement all the concepts in an abstract way has first of all the goal of generalisation. When you write these concepts on paper, it is helpful to see analogies and/or refer one problem to another class of the problems, so in the proof of some properties you might concentrate only on the proof of some small details specific to this type of problem.","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"AlternatingProjections.jl","title":"AlternatingProjections.jl","text":"The same should work also in the programming languages, I hope. For instance, suppose you want now to explain to someone Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm for phase retrieval problem. You might simply describe four simple steps of the algorithm, and it would remain some magic for your listener, or you can formulate it in the framework of feasibility problem, with slightly different type of the feasible sets and slightly different projection operations. With the same easiness it should be possible to be programmed – we need just to  introduce another subtypes of the feasible sets and define the projection operation on them. And this is exactly wat the multiple dispatch feature of Julia does, so that's why I think it might be interesting to try to implement this in Julia. One additional reason, with several algorithms already implemented in one package, it would be easier to make quick experiments, like what if we use this algorithm to that sort of problem?  With proper hierarchies of abstract types for the feasible sets and the methods for the problem solutions, its should be easy.

The realisations should be implemented as concrete types, which cannot have any child types (the abstract types cannot have instantiations). This means that for an abstract type AmplitudeConstrainedSet we should have a concrete subtype, which should have some other name and which should contain some data related to a concrete implementation of the abstract concept. For instance, when in phase retrieval problem one specifies a set of all possible pupil fields with a given field amplitude a as  𝓐_a  =  x in ℂ^Ntimes N    x = a  we can say that this is a structure named, for instance AmplitudeConstrain(a), which is substantiation of a concrete type AmplitudeConstrain, which is, in turn, a subtype of abstract type AmplitudeConstrainedSet.

For instance, whether the backward and forward operations should belong to the method or to the set definition? On one hand, the definitions like ConstrainedBySupport(a) are valid only in some fixed basis, and thus the operations like forward and backward are only use to bring us to the basis where these operations are easier to perform (consider, for instacne, variant of TIP algorithm, where projection of the PSFs can be performed directly in the frequency domain, thus saving two fft operations). On the other hand, the operations like forward and inverse transforms in the GS algorithm, or, in much more extent, component-wise inversion of TIP algorithm, are binded to their names, and same GS without the Fourier transforms and TIP without inversions would be named just alternating projections.
